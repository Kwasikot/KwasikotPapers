## Elements from the Original *Time Capsule Project* Missing in the New UCK Concept

### 1\. **Technical Hardware Details**

- Durability of microchips (30–100 years vs. quartz-based storage lasting millennia).
    
- Protection methods (hermetic sealing, vacuum environment, stable temperature/pressure).
    
- Prototype based on an **e-ink reader with solar battery**.
       
- Specific memory/storage technologies: FeRAM, GaN, ASICs, Project Silica, etc. (with lifetime estimates).

### 2\. **Practical Survival Questions**

- How to restart civilization quickly?
    
- How to teach the scientific method to someone with a “medieval mindset”?
    
- How to make paper and ink from scratch?
    
- How to build a printing press or a lathe with minimal tools?
    
- How to reconstruct a calendar and determine the exact date in the far future?

### 3\. **Capsule Functionality**

- Built-in intelligence (hardware support for reinforcement learning).
    
- Presence of a **radio beacon** and unique IP address for communication between capsules.
    
- Watchdog triggers (atomic clock, mechanical opening event, etc.).

### 4\. **Specific Capsule Contents**

- **Mechanical models** of engines, generators, mills.
    
- **Musical instruments** (e.g., miniature hurdy-gurdy).
    
- **Abacuses, mechanical calculators**.
    
- **Maps, microfilms + microscope** for viewing.
    
- Even the radical proposal of **cryopreserved brains**.
    
- Concrete lists of technologies: fire, food preparation, mills, water purification, lenses.
    
- Lists of tools: stone tools, woodworking and metal tools, medical and navigational instruments.

### 5\. **Social and Cognitive Safeguards**

- Idea of an **IQ-based lock** to prevent access by “the wrong hands” (anti-vandal protection).
    
- Assumption that average IQ of post-catastrophe survivors may be lower.
    
- Psychological motivation through **gamification** (e.g., “build a hammer to unlock the next lesson”).

### 6\. **Knowledge Storage Formats**

- ASCII-based video encoding.
    
- Multi-layer storage: engraved metal, microfilm, digital carriers.
    
- Use of **synthetic DNA** as a storage medium.
    
- Experiments with **“living archives”** (plant/bacterial genomes encoding knowledge).
    

* * *

### 7\. **Mathematical Modeling of Capsule Discovery**

- Probability analysis for Africa (population density, capsule area, ~3,000 capsules needed).
    
- Formula 1−(1−p)N1 - (1 - p)^N1−(1−p)N for probability of discovery.
    
- Emphasis on mass replication and wide geographic distribution, including off-planet placement.

### 8\. **Cultural and Media Ideas**

- GAN-modified films (e.g., replacing faces in Soviet movies → new “filmstrips” per capsule).
    
- Capsule as a **media device** (playing films, sounds, animations).
