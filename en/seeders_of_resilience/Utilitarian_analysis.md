Here’s a **one-screen, utilitarian comparison** (with concrete numbers) between three strategies:

- **GI** = build a *Galactic Internet* (networked, cross-world knowledge mesh)
    
- **LC** = *Local Continuity* only (vaults/cognitive kernels, no interstellar network)
    
- **SQ** = *Status Quo* (no special continuity effort)

# Utilitarian EV Comparison (1,000-year horizon)

**Assumptions (compact):**

- Time horizon: **T = 1,000 years** (= 10 centuries).
    
- Per-century survival probabilities:
    
    - SQ: **0.90** LC: **0.94** GI: **0.98** (base case)
- Expected “civilization-years” (CivY): **EV ≈ T × (p_century)^10**
    
- Network externality multiplier (knowledge spillovers):
    
    - SQ: **×1.00** LC: **×1.05** GI: **×1.20**
- Up-front cost converted to CivY (1 CivY per 10 resource units):
    
    - SQ: **0** LC: **2 CivY** GI: **10 CivY**

**Formula:**

EVnet=T⋅pcentury10⏟survival EV in CivY×E⏟spillover−C⏟cost in CivY\\text{EV}\_\\text{net}=\\underbrace{T\\cdot p_{\\text{century}}^{10}}\_{\\text{survival EV in CivY}}\\times \\underbrace{E}\_{\\text{spillover}}-\\underbrace{C}\_{\\text{cost in CivY}}EVnet​=survival EV in CivYT⋅pcentury10​​​×spilloverE​​−cost in CivYC​​

**Base-case results:**

| Strategy | pcenturyp_{\\text{century}}pcentury​ | Raw EV (CivY) | × Spillover | − Cost | **Net EV (CivY)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SQ  | 0.90 | 348.68 | ×1.00 | −0  | **348.68** |
| LC  | 0.94 | 538.62 | ×1.05 | −2  | **563.55** |
| GI  | 0.98 | 817.07 | ×1.20 | −10 | **970.49** |

**Reading:** GI ≈ **970** CivY vs LC ≈ **564** vs SQ ≈ **349** → **GI dominates** under base assumptions.

* * *

## Sensitivity (how “fragile” the conclusion is)

- If GI’s per-century survival is **0.96** (not 0.98):
    
    - Raw EV = 1000⋅0.9610=664.831000 \\cdot 0.96^{10} = 664.831000⋅0.9610=664.83 → Net EV = 664.83×1.20−10=789.80664.83 \\times 1.20 - 10 = \\mathbf{789.80}664.83×1.20−10=789.80 CivY → **still > LC**.
- If GI’s per-century survival is **0.95**: Net EV ≈ **708.48** CivY → **still > LC**.
    
- **Break-even vs LC:** GI ≈ LC when pcenturyGI≈0.9288p_{\\text{century}}^{\\text{GI}} \\approx \\mathbf{0.9288}pcenturyGI​≈0.9288.
    
    - Intuition: GI remains better **unless** its per-century survival dips below ~**0.929** (e.g., due to detection risk, coordination failures, or network hazards), *or* spillover < 1.2 and/or costs are much higher.

**Spillover & Cost thresholds (quick checks):**

- If GI spillover is only **×1.05** (same as LC), base GI Net EV → 817.07×1.05−10=817.07\\times1.05-10=817.07×1.05−10= **846.92** CivY (still > LC).
    
- If GI cost were **×5 higher** (50 CivY), base GI Net EV → 817.07×1.20−50=817.07\\times1.20-50=817.07×1.20−50= **930.49** CivY (still > LC).
    
- You need **multiple** adverse shifts (lower pcenturyp_{\\text{century}}pcentury​, lower spillovers, **and** much higher costs) for LC to overtake GI.

## Takeaway (utilitarian, one line)

\*\*Even with conservative hits to survival probability or spillovers, the *Galactic Internet* yields the highest expected civilization-years; it only loses to *Local Continuity* if GI’s per-century survival falls below ~\*\*0.929\*\* or spillovers/costs swing dramatically against it.\*\*

From a utilitarian perspective, the rational choice is to pursue the Galactic Internet.
Its expected value in preserved and extended civilization-years far exceeds both Local Continuity and the Status Quo. Even under conservative assumptions about costs, risks, or reduced spillover benefits, the Galactic Internet remains the dominant strategy. Only under extreme downside scenarios—where its per-century survival probability drops below ~0.93 or spillovers vanish—would Local Continuity become preferable. Therefore, if the goal is to maximize total well-being and the long-term flourishing of civilization, building the Galactic Internet is the most rational path.
